DESCRIPTION: <br/> 
Using React, Express.js, Node.js, and MongoDB, I created a Full-stack finance application making it easier for you to track your income and expenses. This dashboard makes it easier for you to see where your money is going towards and helps ensure that you are not exceeding your financial limits. It trackes your income and divides your expenses into multiple categories, and showcases it in a pie chart. <br/>
